# Studio PLAYERS - Optimized version
This is an optimized version of Setro-announce.

Here is original: https://forum.cfx.re/t/release-setro-announce-announcements-system-with-visuals-that-stand-out-and-sound-fixed-bug/130731

# Setroannounce
Introducing Setro-announce, allowing you to make a pretty announcement that stands out to everyone instead of traditional announcements being hidden in a tiny chat message, along with a cool little sound to get everyone’s attention.

The command is restricted to users with “command” ace permissions.
(to give your admins this permission, add add_ace group.admin command allow to your server.cfg).

You can configure how long the message stays for by editing line 3 of client.lua, lastfor, to equal whatever time you want it to display for, in seconds.

Usage: /announce message

That’s all. I hope you like it! :slight_smile:
